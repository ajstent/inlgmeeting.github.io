The final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.\n* Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.\n* Demo papers should be no more than two (2) pages in length, including references, and should describe implemented systems which are of relevance to the NLG community. Authors of demo papers should be willing to present a demo of their system during INLG 2021.\n\nSubmissions of long and short papers should be made through [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org). Please refer to the ARR [call for papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp/) for style files and guidelines.

A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2022 must not have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Dual submission to other conferences is permitted, provided that authors clearly indicate this in the submission form. If the paper is accepted at both venues, the authors will need to choose which venue to present at, since they can not present the same paper twice.","deadline":"March 15, 2022 11:59:59 AOE","id":1,"title":"Call for Papers"},{"body":"sitedata/wcfp.md","bodytext":"A separate call for workshop proposals will be coming soon.","deadline":"March 15, 2022 11:59:59 AOE","id":2,"title":"Call for Workshop Proposals"},{"body":"sitedata/tcfp.md","bodytext":"A separate call for tutorial proposals will be coming soon.","deadline":"March 15, 2022 11:59:59 AOE","id":3,"title":"Call for Tutorial Proposals"},{"body":"sitedata/gccfp.md","bodytext":"A separate call for Generation Challenges will be coming soon.","deadline":"March 15, 2022 11:59:59 AOE","id":4,"title":"Call for Generation Challenges"}]}
